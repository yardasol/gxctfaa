# Grinnell Cross Country, Track & Field Alumni Association
Welcome to the webpage of the Grinnell Cross Country, Track, & Field Alumni Association. I hope that one day this website will serve as a semi-historical resource for current and alumni athletes of the XC and T&F programs to learn about the history of the program. For example, there should a page to look at scans of previous yearbooks, lists of quotes, routes, workouts, photos, videos, playlists, and so on and so forth.

As you can see, it is quite barebones right now. I haven't even formatted anything yet. I plan to get most of the development underway within the next year before I'm so far removed from the institution as to not have any contacts there anymore.

Feel free to browse around what's here right now, and pop an issue in the tracker on the github page if you have an idea or want to help out.

Many thanks,,
